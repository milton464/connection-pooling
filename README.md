# connection-pooling
```
Connection pooling means a pool of Connection Objects. Connection pooling is based on an object pool design pattern.
Object pooling design pattern is used when the cost (time & resources like CPU, Network, and IO) of creating new objects is higher.
In Object pooling design pattern, the application creates an object in advance and place them in Pool or Container.
Whenever our application requires such objects, it acquires them from the pool rather than creating a new one.
